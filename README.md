## Overview

This package provides a complete ROS 2 Jazzy integration for the Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot using the CHAMP controller framework. It includes custom configuration packages and robot description models specifically adapted for ROS 2, enabling simulation, control, and autonomous operation capabilities.

## About Unitree Go2

The Go2 is a quadrupedal robot manufactured by Unitree Robotics, designed for both research and commercial applications. It features powerful actuators, advanced sensor integration, and a robust mechanical design capable of navigating various terrains.

## About CHAMP Controller

CHAMP (Coupled Hybrid Automata for Mobile Platforms) is an open-source development framework designed for quadrupedal robots. It provides a hierarchical control system that combines pattern modulation and impedance control techniques for efficient locomotion.

```

## Usage

### Gazebo Simulation

Launch the Gazebo simulation:

```bash
ros2 launch unitree_go2_sim unitree_go2_launch.py
```

### RVIZ Visualization

Launch Gazebo with RVIZ:

```bash
ros2 launch unitree_go2_sim unitree_go2_launch.py rviz:=true
```

### Teleoperation

Control the robot using keyboard:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

## Tuning Gait Parameters

The gait configuration for the robot is found in `unitree_go2_sim/config/gait/gait.yaml`. You can modify the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Knee Orientation | How the knees should be bent (.>> .>< .<< .<>) |
| Max Linear Velocity X | Maximum forward/reverse speed (m/s) |
| Max Linear Velocity Y | Maximum sideways speed (m/s) |
| Max Angular Velocity Z | Maximum rotational speed (rad/s) |
| Stance Duration | How long each leg spends on the ground while walking |
| Leg Swing Height | Trajectory height during swing phase (m) |
| Leg Stance Height | Trajectory depth during stance phase (m) |
| Robot Walking Height | Distance from hip to ground while walking (m) |
| CoM X Translation | Offset to compensate for weight distribution |
| Odometry Scaler | Multiplier to calculated velocities for dead reckoning |
